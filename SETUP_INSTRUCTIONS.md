# ðŸš€ Job Scraper Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (Without Supabase)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install cheerio puppeteer node-cron @types/node-cron
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Dashboard
Visit: `http://localhost:3002/dashboard`

### 4. Test the Scraper
- Click "Scrape Jobs" button
- The scraper will try to fetch jobs from 10 companies
- Even if some companies fail, you'll get sample jobs for testing

## With Supabase (Recommended for Production)

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Get your project URL and API keys

### 2. Set Up Database
1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL to create tables and functions

### 3. Environment Variables
Create `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### 4. Test with Supabase
- The app will now store jobs in Supabase
- You can like/unlike jobs (requires authentication)
- Jobs persist between scraping sessions

### ðŸ”§ How It Works:
1. **Scraper**: Uses Puppeteer + Cheerio to extract job data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No Jobs Found**
   - This is normal for demo - the scraper creates sample jobs
   - With real scraping, some companies may block requests
   - The fallback system ensures you always see jobs

2. **Scraping Takes Long**
   - Limited to 10 companies to avoid timeout
   - Each company has a 2-second delay
   - You can adjust the limit in the code

3. **Supabase Errors**
   - Check your environment variables
   - Ensure database schema is set up
   - Check Supabase project is active

### Performance Tips:
- Use Supabase for production (faster than in-memory)
- Enable authentication for like functionality
- Adjust company limits based on your needs
- Monitor console logs for debugging

## Next Steps:
1. **Test the scraper** with current setup
2. **Add Supabase** for persistent storage
3. **Customize selectors** for better scraping
4. **Add more companies** as needed
5. **Deploy to production** with proper environment variables

The scraper is designed to be robust and will always provide jobs for testing, even if real scraping fails!
