# Background music for Palak

Add these MP3 files to this folder so the story and celebration pages can play them in the background:

| File name       | Used on                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| `zaalima.mp3`   | Story slide 1, Yes page   |
| `lover.mp3`     | Story slide 2              |
| `golden-hour.mp3` | Story slide 3           |
| `jogi.mp3`      | Story slide 4              |

**How to get the files:** Use music you own (purchased downloads, CDs you’ve ripped, or streaming services that allow offline files). Place the files in `public/palak/` with the exact names above.

Browsers require a user tap before playing sound, so music will start after the first tap (e.g. “Next” or “Play music”) on the story page, and after a tap on the yes page.
