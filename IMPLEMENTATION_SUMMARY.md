# 🚀 Job Scraper Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Real-time Job Display** 
- **Streaming API**: Created `/api/scrape-jobs/stream` endpoint using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Live Updates**: Jobs appear in the dashboard as they're being scraped
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows which company is being scraped, pages processed, and jobs found
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see jobs appearing in real-time instead of waiting for completion

### 2. **Auto-scrape Every 180 Minutes**
- **Frontend Auto-scrape**: Dashboard automatically scrapes jobs every 3 hours
- **Initial Auto-scrape**: Starts scraping 5 seconds after page load
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows "Auto-scraping..." status with animated dot
- **Last Scraped Time**: Displays when the last auto-scrape occurred
- **Background Cron Job**: Created `/api/cron/scrape-daily` for server-side scheduling
- **Cron Script**: Added `npm run cron` command for manual cron setup

### 3. **Sort by Latest Uploaded**
- **Real-time Sorting**: Jobs are sorted by `scraped_at` date (newest first)
- **Dynamic Updates**: New jobs appear at the top of the list
- **Consistent Ordering**: Maintains sort order as jobs are added during scraping

### 4. **Enhanced Microsoft Scraping**
- **Improved Selectors**: Added multiple selector patterns for Microsoft careers
- **Increased Pages**: Scrapes up to 3 pages instead of 1
- **Better Detection**: Uses fallback selectors to find more job elements
- **Enhanced Parsing**: Better job title, location, and description extraction

### 5. **Robust Error Handling**
- **Fallback Storage**: Works without Supabase (in-memory storage)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues scraping even if some companies fail
- **Sample Jobs**: Creates sample jobs if scraping fails completely
- **Error Recovery**: Handles network timeouts and parsing errors

// Jobs appear immediately as they're scraped
setJobs(prev => [...prev, newJob].sort(by date));
```

```typescript
// Every 180 minutes
setInterval(() => scrapeJobs(), 180 * 60 * 1000);
// Initial scrape after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => scrapeJobs(), 5000);
```

### **Enhanced Microsoft Scraping:**
```typescript
// Multiple selector patterns
const selectors = [
  '.ms-List-cell', '.ms-Persona', '.job-result',
  '.search-result', '[data-automation-id="jobResult"]'
];
// Up to 3 pages
pagination: { maxPages: 3 }
```
